## What led to this? ü§î
Somewhere in March 2020, COVID-19 struck the world rendering it motionless and with heavy losses and yada-yada, yes you know what happens after the entire "one man had to eat a bat soup" incident. The point we would like to stress is the rise of work from home culture it brought up.

Folks are working from home more, correct?
*But are folks working from home with an extended safety of privacy?* Not really. 

Imagine a scenario where...
1. **A meeting outside**
- You are working in a cafe or in a metro with your masks and earphones on.
- You are attending a very important meeting with sensitive information on display.
- You are listening to all of it keenly but...
- The people next to you keep staring at your screen and yes, we know, it gets uncomfortable. :)

2. **A call with friends at home**
- You are being yourself with your friends 
- Your friends does something extremely hilarious which well, you probably won't show your folks

Now, you can't really change people can you? 
**But you can definitely change your meeting** ‚ù§Ô∏è
